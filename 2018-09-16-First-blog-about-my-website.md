		First blog about my website and what i achieved during the lesson

During the lesson i was asked to write down everything that i knew about css and to be frank i didn't know very much. I knew that you could add a border and change the font but not much else. After i used the css file on github i realised how much more i could achieve with the css and how much better i could make the website with some guidelines.

I think that i have achieved the homework aims for this lesson and i hope that Mr Burn thinks that about my website too.
